Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct word as a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that they capture the **semantic and syntactic qualities of words**; as such, a simple mathematical function (cosine similarity) can indicate the level of semantic similarity between the words represented by those vectors.\n",

But FastText can produce vectors better than random by breaking the above word in chunks and using the vectors for those chunks to create a final vector for the word.
